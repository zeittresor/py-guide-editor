Extended Amiga Guide File-Editor in Python

Written by Zeittresor

This is a placeholder for a File-Editor i am writing using python to create extended documents in the amiga guide (.guide) file format.

Its just a beginning not the final version so far..

Goals are mostly the same like my (already usable project py-guide-viewer):

- Open / Save Amiga Guide Files using a GUI
- Editor to create Documents in Guide File-Format with easy to use WYSIWYG Buttons to link to subpages
- Textformation using well knowen textfunctions in a GUI
- Multi Language Support (English, German, French)
- Extended to add embeddings like Graphic Files (UUENC Encoded) or music into the document.
